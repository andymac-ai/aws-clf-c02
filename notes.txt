Services

IAM (Identity and Access Management) - manage users access, controls, and permissions for users within the organization
  IAM MFA (Multi-Factor Authorization) - makes a user have multiple devices to prove their identity
  AWS Access Keys - Long-term credentials for individual IAM accounts
  CLI (Command Line Interface) - tool to manage AWS tools, provides a command line interface to configure and control multiple services
  SDK (Software Development Kit) - contains tools to develop applications with AWS with different programming languages (eg JS, Java, React, Python, etc.)
  CloudShell - online command line shell environment, preloaded with tools and automatically updated

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - cloud-based cloud computation service
  EC2 Instance Connect - tool to connect to an EC2 instance

EC2 Instance Storage - storage options to optimize performance vs. cost
  EBS (Elastic Block Store) - block level storage volumes to EC2 instances, multiple EBS volumes can be attached to each EC2 instance
  AMI (Amazon Machine Image) - creates images (templates) of AWS EC2 instances to be used as masters for instance pools
  EFS (Elastic File System) - auto-scaling file system that grows/shrinks as files are added/removed

ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) - automatically balances application traffic to a different targets and appliances across multiple availabiliy zones
ASG (Auto Scaling Groups) - each group contains multiple EC2 instances and provides autoscaling based on needs, only horizontal (number of instances, not performance of instances)
