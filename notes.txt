Services

IAM (Identity and Access Management) - manage users access, controls, and permissions for users within the organization
  IAM MFA (Multi-Factor Authorization) - makes a user have multiple devices to prove their identity
  AWS Access Keys - Long-term credentials for individual IAM accounts
  CLI (Command Line Interface) - tool to manage AWS tools, provides a command line interface to configure and control multiple services
  SDK (Software Development Kit) - contains tools to develop applications with AWS with different programming languages (eg JS, Java, React, Python, etc.)
  CloudShell - online command line shell environment, preloaded with tools and automatically updated

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - cloud-based cloud computation service
  EC2 Instance Connect - tool to connect to an EC2 instance

EC2 Instance Storage - storage options to optimize performance vs. cost
  EBS (Elastic Block Store) - block level storage volumes to EC2 instances, multiple EBS volumes can be attached to each EC2 instance
  AMI (Amazon Machine Image) - creates images (templates) of AWS EC2 instances to be used as masters for instance pools
  EFS (Elastic File System) - auto-scaling file system that grows/shrinks as files are added/removed

ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) - automatically balances application traffic to a different targets and appliances across multiple availabiliy zones
ASG (Auto Scaling Groups) - each group contains multiple EC2 instances and provides autoscaling based on needs, only horizontal (number of instances, not performance of instances)

Amazon S3 - object storage service, designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability and stores millions of customers data
  AWS Snow - provides computation at the edge or migration from edge devices to the cloud
    AWS Snowcone - small, portable device for local transfer and physical shipment an AWS facility
    AWS Snowball - larger, portable device can be optimized for storage or compute

Databases
  RDS (Relational Database Services) - managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle BYOL, or SQL server
  Elasticache - fast, in-memory data store for use as a database, cache, message broker
  DynamoDB - fully managed proprietary NoSQL database 
  Redshift - petabyte-scale data warehouse and exabyte-scale data lake analytics
  EMR (Elastic MapReduce) - petabyte data processing, interactive analytics and machine learning, uses open source frameworks including Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto
  Quicksight - business analytics tool
  DocumentDB - JSON document database
  Neptune - graph database for billions of relationships
  Timestream - time series databse
  QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database) - ledger database that provides transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log
  Managed Blockchain - allows user to build resilient Web3 application on both public and private blockchains
  Glue - serverless data integration service, allows users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources
  DMS (Database Migration Service) - assists in moving databases and workloads into AWS

Other Compute Services:
  ECS (Elastic Container Service) - allows for managed container orchestration to easliy deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications 
  Lambda - serveless computing, runs code in many different languages (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, etc) and manages resources, scaling to deÂ´ploy the functinos
  API Gateway - fully managed service to allow developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure API's at any scale
  Batch - plans, schedules, and runs containerized batch ML, simulation, and analytics workloads across the full range of AWS compute offerings
  Lightsail - a virtual private server used to store data, run code, build web-based aplications
